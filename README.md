I made this on my PC and it is owned by me, there will be a another one which will be scripted and coded and will have the C/C microsoft edit pack or whatever It is called, if any damage is done It's not my fault you should see if they are working, execpt for bluescreen since that one clearly work's but won't affect you but there will be a alot of registry changes
And as i already said no damage is my fault I just want to post a cool malware you can use this on a VM for a video, or just to test it out
It may not work but there will be a new version, If someone claim's this is their's it isn't it is originaly mine
Please dont use this to prank somebody, unless you've edited many thing's and yes i have also made some useless ones
But it's for some backup, although this "malware" may be in public you should still not underestimate it
If it dosent work and you wanted to test it out for some video on a VM sorry i should've knowen
But i don't know how to use a VM so am sorry about that, however do not delete this readme file! this might be useful if you get sent
this by some unknowen user, am not sure if you would trust a unknowen user, but i know they probably wont listen and send this to you
be careful and watch out if you have seen something like this similar, ust incase.

This is the first version of this malware
As soon i will be able to make a C/C microsoft scripting or whatever it is
But yea soon I will use the microsoft scripting program and it will be only one exe
maybe not a exe but might be, or the software of your choice to run this as that actually works
however i don't know how to set up a software publisher but might take a look at tutorials
and i am not gonna say it again.

|If any damage is caused by this program it is not my fault, you should have checked it out or run it as a VM
|And please don't send this to somebody and bait them to fall for it
|And do not delete this read me file unless you have already read this
|I was also inspired for other viruses but i haven't found a way of setting a theme without using a programmer app.
|You can make a video about this but you can also test if it works out first

I already know this won't be popular but if you see this
It would be pretty rare.
If you want to launch it execute server.vbs and startup.bat
And you can also run this as administrator mode as well
Might not be a change but incase you want to.
When running a app you might encounter a VBS error which really sucks
but might be fixed in the next version since i might use a scripting program
As i have not found a way to add themes, and make it a singular file without
using a scripting program might take a look at how to add a software
for launching your own .exe programs

|Warning: please don't try this unless you know what you are doing you can try this on a VM
also on your primary PC but i don't recommend that
But you can also see if it even work's
Incase it dosent there will be a new version, although it might work
Which will probably be since most of the code i typed are correct
But there might be a vbs. error so rip
untill the next version
I will also need a scripting program
Sorry for the amount of txt messages you will get when using server.vbs
and annoyances it can be declined or declined only if you go even further who knows
